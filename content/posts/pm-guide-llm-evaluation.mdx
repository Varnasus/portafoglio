# The PM's Guide to LLM Evaluation Frameworks

*May 25, 2024*

As a Product Manager working with LLMs, one of the most challenging aspects is knowing whether your AI system is actually performing well. Traditional software metrics don't apply, and the evaluation landscape is constantly evolving.

After building evaluation frameworks for multiple LLM products, I've learned that effective evaluation isn't about finding the perfect metricâ€”it's about building a comprehensive framework that captures real-world performance.

## The Evaluation Challenge

LLM evaluation is fundamentally different from traditional software evaluation:

- **No single "correct" answer** - Multiple valid responses to the same input
- **Subjective quality** - What's "good" depends on context and user needs
- **Context-dependent performance** - Same model performs differently in different scenarios
- **Continuous evolution** - Models and use cases change over time
- **Human judgment required** - Automated metrics don't capture everything

The key insight is that LLM evaluation requires a multi-faceted approach that combines automated metrics with human judgment.

## Building a Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

Here's the framework I use for evaluating LLM performance in production systems:

### 1. Define Success Criteria

Start by clearly defining what success looks like for your specific use case:

```python
# Example success criteria for a support chatbot
SUCCESS_CRITERIA = {
    "accuracy": {
        "target": 0.85,
        "measurement": "Human expert evaluation score"
    },
    "completeness": {
        "target": 0.90,
        "measurement": "Percentage of user questions addressed"
    },
    "helpfulness": {
        "target": 4.2,
        "measurement": "User satisfaction score (1-5)"
    },
    "efficiency": {
        "target": 30,
        "measurement": "Average seconds to resolution"
    }
}
```

### 2. Automated Metrics

Implement automated metrics for continuous monitoring:

#### Accuracy Metrics

```python
def calculate_accuracy_metrics(predictions, references):
    # Exact match accuracy
    exact_match = sum(p == r for p, r in zip(predictions, references)) / len(predictions)
    
    # Semantic similarity using embeddings
    semantic_similarity = calculate_embedding_similarity(predictions, references)
    
    # BLEU score for text generation
    bleu_score = calculate_bleu_score(predictions, references)
    
    return {
        "exact_match": exact_match,
        "semantic_similarity": semantic_similarity,
        "bleu_score": bleu_score
    }
```

#### Completeness Metrics

```python
def calculate_completeness(response, user_query):
    # Check if response addresses all parts of the query
    query_aspects = extract_query_aspects(user_query)
    addressed_aspects = extract_addressed_aspects(response)
    
    completeness = len(addressed_aspects) / len(query_aspects)
    return completeness
```

#### Consistency Metrics

```python
def calculate_consistency(responses, similar_queries):
    # Measure consistency across similar queries
    consistency_scores = []
    
    for query_group in similar_queries:
        group_responses = [responses[q] for q in query_group]
        consistency = calculate_response_similarity(group_responses)
        consistency_scores.append(consistency)
    
    return np.mean(consistency_scores)
```

### 3. Human Evaluation

Automated metrics are necessary but not sufficient. Human evaluation provides the gold standard:

#### Evaluation Rubric

Create a structured rubric for human evaluators:

```python
EVALUATION_RUBRIC = {
    "accuracy": {
        "5": "Completely accurate, no factual errors",
        "4": "Mostly accurate, minor errors",
        "3": "Somewhat accurate, some errors",
        "2": "Many errors, but some correct information",
        "1": "Completely inaccurate"
    },
    "completeness": {
        "5": "Addresses all aspects of the query",
        "4": "Addresses most aspects, minor gaps",
        "3": "Addresses some aspects, notable gaps",
        "2": "Addresses few aspects, major gaps",
        "1": "Does not address the query"
    },
    "helpfulness": {
        "5": "Extremely helpful, solves the problem",
        "4": "Very helpful, mostly solves the problem",
        "3": "Somewhat helpful, partial solution",
        "2": "Not very helpful, minimal value",
        "1": "Not helpful, creates confusion"
    }
}
```

#### Evaluation Process

1. **Sample Selection** - Randomly sample interactions for evaluation
2. **Blind Evaluation** - Evaluators don't know which model generated responses
3. **Multiple Evaluators** - Use multiple evaluators for reliability
4. **Disagreement Resolution** - Process for handling evaluator disagreements

### 4. User Feedback Integration

Incorporate real user feedback into your evaluation framework:

```python
def collect_user_feedback(interaction_id, response):
    # Collect explicit feedback
    satisfaction_score = get_user_rating(interaction_id)
    
    # Collect implicit feedback
    follow_up_questions = get_follow_up_count(interaction_id)
    escalation_rate = get_escalation_rate(interaction_id)
    
    # Calculate composite feedback score
    feedback_score = calculate_feedback_score(
        satisfaction_score,
        follow_up_questions,
        escalation_rate
    )
    
    return feedback_score
```

## Real-World Implementation Example

Here's how I implemented evaluation for a customer support chatbot:

### Evaluation Framework

```python
class SupportChatbotEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            "automated": AutomatedMetrics(),
            "human": HumanEvaluator(),
            "user_feedback": UserFeedbackCollector()
        }
    
    def evaluate_performance(self, interactions):
        results = {}
        
        # Automated evaluation
        results["automated"] = self.metrics["automated"].evaluate(interactions)
        
        # Human evaluation (sampled)
        sample_interactions = self.sample_interactions(interactions, size=100)
        results["human"] = self.metrics["human"].evaluate(sample_interactions)
        
        # User feedback
        results["user_feedback"] = self.metrics["user_feedback"].collect(interactions)
        
        return self.combine_results(results)
```

### Key Metrics Tracked

- **Response Accuracy**: 87% (target: 85%)
- **Query Completeness**: 92% (target: 90%)
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.3/5 (target: 4.2)
- **Resolution Rate**: 78% (target: 75%)
- **Average Response Time**: 28 seconds (target: 30)

## Evaluation Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Iterate

Don't try to build the perfect evaluation framework from day one:

- **Phase 1**: Basic automated metrics
- **Phase 2**: Add human evaluation
- **Phase 3**: Integrate user feedback
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and insights

### 2. Focus on Actionable Metrics

Every metric should drive decisions:

```python
# Actionable metrics example
ACTIONABLE_METRICS = {
    "escalation_rate": {
        "threshold": 0.15,
        "action": "Review model performance on complex queries"
    },
    "user_satisfaction": {
        "threshold": 4.0,
        "action": "Investigate low-satisfaction interactions"
    },
    "response_time": {
        "threshold": 30,
        "action": "Optimize model or infrastructure"
    }
}
```

### 3. Regular Evaluation Cycles

Establish regular evaluation cycles:

- **Daily**: Automated metrics monitoring
- **Weekly**: Human evaluation of samples
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive performance review
- **Quarterly**: Framework updates and improvements

### 4. Context-Aware Evaluation

Different use cases require different evaluation approaches:

```python
# Context-specific evaluation
EVALUATION_CONTEXTS = {
    "customer_support": {
        "primary_metrics": ["accuracy", "helpfulness", "resolution_rate"],
        "evaluation_frequency": "daily"
    },
    "content_generation": {
        "primary_metrics": ["quality", "creativity", "relevance"],
        "evaluation_frequency": "weekly"
    },
    "data_analysis": {
        "primary_metrics": ["accuracy", "completeness", "insightfulness"],
        "evaluation_frequency": "monthly"
    }
}
```

## Common Evaluation Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Reliance on Automated Metrics

Automated metrics are proxies, not the real thing:

- **Problem**: Relying solely on BLEU scores or exact matches
- **Solution**: Combine with human evaluation and user feedback

### 2. Ignoring Context

The same response can be good or bad depending on context:

- **Problem**: Evaluating responses in isolation
- **Solution**: Evaluate in realistic usage scenarios

### 3. Not Measuring User Impact

Technical performance doesn't always align with user value:

- **Problem**: Focusing only on model accuracy
- **Solution**: Measure business outcomes and user satisfaction

### 4. Static Evaluation

Evaluation frameworks need to evolve:

- **Problem**: Using the same metrics forever
- **Solution**: Regularly review and update evaluation criteria

## Advanced Evaluation Techniques

### A/B Testing

Compare different models or configurations:

```python
def run_ab_test(model_a, model_b, test_queries):
    results_a = evaluate_model(model_a, test_queries)
    results_b = evaluate_model(model_b, test_queries)
    
    # Statistical significance testing
    significance = calculate_statistical_significance(results_a, results_b)
    
    return {
        "model_a": results_a,
        "model_b": results_b,
        "significance": significance,
        "recommendation": "model_a" if results_a > results_b else "model_b"
    }
```

### Continuous Evaluation

Implement continuous evaluation in production:

```python
def continuous_evaluation_system():
    while True:
        # Collect new interactions
        new_interactions = collect_recent_interactions()
        
        # Run automated evaluation
        automated_scores = evaluate_automated(new_interactions)
        
        # Sample for human evaluation
        if should_sample():
            human_scores = evaluate_human(sample_interactions(new_interactions))
        
        # Update performance dashboard
        update_dashboard(automated_scores, human_scores)
        
        # Alert if performance degrades
        if performance_degraded():
            send_alert("Performance degradation detected")
        
        time.sleep(3600)  # Check every hour
```
