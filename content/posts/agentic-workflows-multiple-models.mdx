# Building Agentic Workflows: When to Use Multiple Models

*April 15, 2024*

One of the most critical decisions when building agentic workflows is whether to use a single model or multiple models. This choice affects everything from system complexity to cost, performance, and maintainability.

After building agentic systems that process thousands of interactions daily, I've learned that the decision isn't about using the most powerful modelâ€”it's about using the right model for each specific task.

## The Single vs. Multi-Model Decision

The choice between single-model and multi-model architectures depends on several factors:

### When to Use a Single Model

**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity** - Easier to build, deploy, and maintain
- **Consistency** - Same model behavior across all tasks
- **Cost efficiency** - No overhead from model switching
- **Faster development** - Less complexity means faster time to market

**Best for:**
- **Simple workflows** - Straightforward tasks with clear requirements
- **Prototypes** - Quick validation of concepts
- **Resource constraints** - Limited engineering resources
- **Consistent quality** - When all tasks require similar capabilities

### When to Use Multiple Models

**Advantages:**
- **Task optimization** - Each model optimized for specific tasks
- **Cost optimization** - Use cheaper models for simple tasks
- **Performance** - Better results through specialization
- **Flexibility** - Adapt to different task requirements

**Best for:**
- **Complex workflows** - Multiple distinct task types
- **Cost-sensitive applications** - Need to optimize for cost
- **Performance-critical systems** - Require best possible results
- **Production systems** - Long-term maintainability and optimization

## Multi-Model Architecture Patterns

Here are the key patterns I've used in production systems:

### 1. Task-Based Routing

Route requests to specialized models based on task type:

```python
class TaskBasedRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_mapping = {
            "classification": "gpt-3.5-turbo",      # Fast, cheap
            "analysis": "gpt-4",                    # Accurate, expensive
            "generation": "claude-3-sonnet",        # Creative, balanced
            "summarization": "gpt-3.5-turbo",       # Efficient
            "reasoning": "gpt-4"                    # Complex logic
        }
    
    def route_request(self, user_input, task_type):
        model = self.model_mapping.get(task_type, "gpt-3.5-turbo")
        return self.call_model(model, user_input)
    
    def call_model(self, model, input):
        # Implementation for calling specific model
        pass
```

### 2. Confidence-Based Escalation

Start with cheaper models, escalate to more powerful ones when needed:

```python
class ConfidenceBasedRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = [
            ("gpt-3.5-turbo", 0.8),    # Try first, escalate if confidence < 0.8
            ("gpt-4", 0.9),            # Second choice, escalate if confidence < 0.9
            ("claude-3-opus", 1.0)     # Final fallback
        ]
    
    def process_with_escalation(self, user_input):
        for model, confidence_threshold in self.models:
            response, confidence = self.call_model(model, user_input)
            
            if confidence >= confidence_threshold:
                return response, model
        
        # If all models fail, return best response
        return response, self.models[-1][0]
```

### 3. Pipeline Architecture

Use different models for different stages of processing:

```python
class PipelineProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages = [
            ("classification", "gpt-3.5-turbo"),
            ("extraction", "gpt-4"),
            ("analysis", "claude-3-sonnet"),
            ("generation", "gpt-4")
        ]
    
    def process_pipeline(self, user_input):
        context = {"original_input": user_input}
        
        for stage_name, model in self.stages:
            stage_result = self.process_stage(stage_name, model, context)
            context[stage_name] = stage_result
        
        return context["generation"]
```

## Real-World Implementation Example

Let me share how I implemented a multi-model system for document processing:

### System Requirements

- **Document classification** - Categorize incoming documents
- **Information extraction** - Extract key data points
- **Content analysis** - Analyze document content
- **Summary generation** - Create executive summaries
- **Cost constraint** - Keep processing under $0.05 per document

### Architecture Design

```python
class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            "classifier": ModelConfig("gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens=100),
            "extractor": ModelConfig("gpt-4", max_tokens=500),
            "analyzer": ModelConfig("claude-3-sonnet", max_tokens=1000),
            "summarizer": ModelConfig("gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens=300)
        }
    
    def process_document(self, document):
        # Stage 1: Classification (cheap, fast)
        doc_type = self.classify_document(document)
        
        # Stage 2: Extraction (accurate, moderate cost)
        extracted_data = self.extract_information(document, doc_type)
        
        # Stage 3: Analysis (comprehensive, expensive)
        analysis = self.analyze_content(document, extracted_data)
        
        # Stage 4: Summary (efficient, cheap)
        summary = self.generate_summary(analysis)
        
        return {
            "type": doc_type,
            "data": extracted_data,
            "analysis": analysis,
            "summary": summary
        }
```

### Performance Results

- **Cost per document**: $0.03 (40% below target)
- **Processing time**: 45 seconds average
- **Accuracy**: 92% across all stages
- **Reliability**: 99.5% success rate

## Model Selection Criteria

When choosing models for different tasks, consider these factors:

### 1. Task Complexity

```python
TASK_COMPLEXITY_MAPPING = {
    "simple_classification": {
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "reasoning": "Fast, cheap, sufficient accuracy"
    },
    "complex_analysis": {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "reasoning": "Requires advanced reasoning capabilities"
    },
    "creative_generation": {
        "model": "claude-3-sonnet",
        "reasoning": "Better creative writing capabilities"
    }
}
```

### 2. Cost Sensitivity

```python
COST_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY = {
    "high_volume": {
        "primary": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "fallback": "gpt-4",
        "threshold": 0.7
    },
    "low_volume": {
        "primary": "gpt-4",
        "fallback": "claude-3-opus",
        "threshold": 0.9
    }
}
```

### 3. Performance Requirements

```python
PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENTS = {
    "real_time": {
        "latency_target": "< 2 seconds",
        "models": ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "claude-3-haiku"]
    },
    "batch_processing": {
        "latency_target": "< 30 seconds",
        "models": ["gpt-4", "claude-3-sonnet"]
    }
}
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Optimize Later

Don't over-engineer from the beginning:

```python
# Phase 1: Single model
def simple_processor(input):
    return call_model("gpt-4", input)

# Phase 2: Add routing
def routed_processor(input, task_type):
    model = select_model(task_type)
    return call_model(model, input)

# Phase 3: Add optimization
def optimized_processor(input, task_type, constraints):
    model = select_optimal_model(task_type, constraints)
    return call_model(model, input)
```

### 2. Implement Proper Error Handling

Multi-model systems need robust error handling:

```python
class RobustModelRouter:
    def call_model_with_fallback(self, primary_model, fallback_model, input):
        try:
            return self.call_model(primary_model, input)
        except ModelError:
            logging.warning(f"Primary model {primary_model} failed, using fallback")
            return self.call_model(fallback_model, input)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"All models failed: {e}")
            return self.handle_complete_failure(input)
```

### 3. Monitor and Optimize

Continuous monitoring is essential:

```python
class ModelPerformanceMonitor:
    def track_performance(self, model, task_type, performance_metrics):
        self.metrics[model][task_type].append(performance_metrics)
        
        # Analyze trends
        if self.should_optimize(model, task_type):
            self.optimize_model_selection(model, task_type)
    
    def should_optimize(self, model, task_type):
        recent_performance = self.get_recent_performance(model, task_type)
        return recent_performance["accuracy"] < 0.85 or recent_performance["cost"] > 0.05
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Engineering

Don't build complex multi-model systems for simple problems:

- **Problem**: Using 5 different models for a simple chatbot
- **Solution**: Start with one model, add complexity only when needed

### 2. Ignoring Latency

Model switching adds latency:

- **Problem**: 3-second response time due to multiple model calls
- **Solution**: Cache results and optimize routing logic

### 3. Not Monitoring Costs

Multi-model systems can be expensive:

- **Problem**: Costs spiral due to expensive model usage
- **Solution**: Implement cost monitoring and optimization

### 4. Poor Error Handling

Complex systems fail in complex ways:

- **Problem**: System crashes when one model fails
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

## Key Decision Framework

Use this framework to decide between single and multi-model architectures:

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Single Model | Multi-Model |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Cost** | Predictable | Variable |
| **Performance** | Consistent | Optimized |
| **Maintenance** | Easy | Complex |
| **Flexibility** | Low | High |

### Decision Criteria

1. **Task Diversity**: Multiple distinct task types â†’ Multi-model
2. **Cost Sensitivity**: High volume, low margin â†’ Multi-model
3. **Performance Requirements**: Critical performance needs â†’ Multi-model
4. **Resource Constraints**: Limited engineering resources â†’ Single model
5. **Time to Market**: Rapid prototyping â†’ Single model

## Looking Forward

The future of multi-model architectures will focus on:

- **Dynamic model selection** - AI-powered model routing
- **Cost-aware optimization** - Real-time cost-performance optimization
- **Specialized models** - Domain-specific models for specific tasks
- **Automated optimization** - Self-optimizing model selection

## Conclusion

The choice between single-model and multi-model architectures depends on your specific requirements, constraints, and goals. The key is to start simple and add complexity only when it provides clear benefits.

For most applications, I recommend starting with a single model and evolving to multi-model architectures as you understand your requirements better. The companies that succeed will be those that can balance simplicity with optimization.

Remember: the best architecture is the one that meets your requirements with the least complexity. Don't over-engineer, but don't under-optimize either.
